# Finance---Portfolio-management
I am taking Coursera's specialization on Investment Management with Python and Machine Learning. The files uploaded in this section are what I have learned while taking the first course of the specialization which is 'Introduction to Portfolio Construction and Analysis with Python'.
The only file which I have uploaded contains some functions which are used in the portfolio construction for the relevant financial data.
